# Anime Recommendation System

This repository is focused on implementing a Recommendation System using cosine similarity on the anime.csv dataset.
The system recommends similar anime titles based on features such as genre, ratings, and user preferences.

---

## Objective

To design and implement a recommendation system that suggests anime titles similar to a given input anime.
This assignment provides hands-on experience in cosine similarity-based recommendation, feature engineering, and evaluation using precision/recall metrics.

## Tasks Performed

* Data Preprocessing: handled missing values and explored dataset attributes
* Feature Extraction: selected genres, ratings, and episodes as features; converted categorical variables into numerical form
* Cosine Similarity: implemented similarity-based recommendation function
* Recommendation Engine: generated top-N recommendations for a given anime
* Evaluation: used precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate system performance
* Insights: discussed strengths, limitations, and possible improvements

## Status

Completed – dataset preprocessed, recommendation system implemented, and performance evaluated.
Prepared for further extensions such as collaborative filtering or hybrid recommendation systems.
